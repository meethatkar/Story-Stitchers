        story: "The campfire crackled, casting dancing shadows among the towering pines. Sarah, Mark, and Emily had ignored the old local's warnings about the Blackwood Forest. Deep in the woods, an unnerving silence fell, broken only by the rustling of leaves and what sounded like faint whispers carried on the wind. Later, huddled in their tents, a chill seeped into their sleeping bags. A rhythmic tapping began, not on their tent, but from within the surrounding trees. It grew louder, accompanied by what sounded like a child's giggle â€“ distorted and far too close. Mark peered through the mesh, seeing nothing but the impenetrable darkness. Then, a single, glowing eye opened in the black, staring back. They didn't scream; they simply froze, listening to the forest breathing."

        story: "The headlights cut through the dense fog on the Delhi Cantt road. Aryan, driving home late, felt an inexplicable chill despite the warm night. Ahead, a solitary figure emerged from the swirling mist: a woman in a white saree, her back to him. He slowed, wary. As he passed, she was suddenly inside his back seat. Her hair, long and black, obscured her face. A faint scent of old flowers filled the car. Aryan's hands gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white. The temperature inside plummeted. A cold breath ghosted across his ear. \"Drop me at the cemetery,\" a raspy voice whispered. He slammed the brakes, heart hammering, and looked back. The seat was empty, but the faint scent of jasmine lingered, a chilling reminder of his spectral passenger."
